## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

 We were able to finish all the functionalities for the planned post-mvp features, they just need to be polished/have very minor issues. 

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

We had some responsiveness issues with different systems/resolutions. We also faced the challenge of API rate limits and request limits, which caused some issues during the practice demo as well.

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

We finished all the planned tasks.

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

Stack overflow and youtube videos were very helpful with deploying. Our mentors were also an amazing resource. They pointed out many details that we could polish and improve on, which was very helpful.

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

The home page might be considered at risk. Aileen was able to cache the data in the backend and connect it to the front end, but we still have to look into deploying Redis with heroku. We also need to do more testing to see if the TTL for each key is appropriate. If it remains at risk, we will look into upgrading the license.
