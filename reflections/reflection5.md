## Reflection Questions

* How was the pacing of the capstone project? (i.e too slow, just right, too fast) 
The pacing of the capstone project was just right in our experience.

* To what extent did your plan change over the course of development? Knowing that you know now, what would you do differently if you were starting over?

We've had a lot of changes once we got feedback from our 1:1s with our mentors, during our pod sync, and after demoing every week infront of the cohort. What we would do differently is, nailing down on the design first. We had to go through more design changes that ideal, so making sure that everyone is happy with how the website will look in the design phase would become a higher priority.

* How helpful were the labs and weekly assignments in preparing you to create a capstone project? Be specific, what topics do you still have questions about that may or may not have been covered?

I would not have been able to do most of our capstone without the labs and weekly assignments. Each lab and project built on each other week after week and our capstone project truly was a culmination of all of those skills we learned.


* When planning for the capstone project, which resources were the most helpful? (i.e mentors, instructors & TAs, ideation process, pod syncs, wireframes, sprint planning, bug bash, practice demo day, etc.)

The most helpful resource was definitely through the pod sync. Having three experienced SWEs in the same room as you, valuable doesn't even begin to describe it. Also being able to bounce ideas off of your fellow pod mates, this was a huge component to our collaboration and effectiveness.
