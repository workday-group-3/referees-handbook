## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.
Thanks to Aileen, last week we were able to cache data in the backend so that our api calls for the sports home would not hit their limit during our presentations. And thanks to her and Travis, we were able to get redis deployed with Heroku this week. 


* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

 Deploying the cached data was quite challenging. On the front end, we decided to use netlify as a better resource for deployment. Props to Travis for sticking to it and getting us where we needed to be on that end. 

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

 We were able to finish all of our tasks for the week. Moving forward, there are some minute UI changes we still need to make but functionality wise our website is in a good spot.

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

 Our mentor meetings were an extraordinary resourse. They helped in finding bugs for our site. We spent the first few days this week patching them up. Also, Obi and Phineas were great for UI/UX advice.

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

We currently have no user stories at risk.
