## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

 We had an amazing demo, and were able to show all our features in a fun way as well. 

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

 The day before the demo, our group decided to change our presentation format entirely, so we had to practice lots to get familiar with the script. Luckily our mentors were extremely helpful and gave us feedback and encouragement along the way. In the end, the demo went great.

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

 We finished everything and were able to really polish our website.

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

 Yes, our mentors were an especially helpful resource to us on planning our demo. Cross group testing was also very helpful, and we were able to receive and give useful feedback.

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

 All features are completed and all user stories are covered.
